Lift
====
software to simulate a number of lifts

to run this program, compile all files then type:

java ExecuteLift2 paramsX.txt instructionsY.txt

where X is a version of the lift params file and Y is the version of the instructions file.  note that Y can contain no instructions as these are simply to provide the lift with a few button calls on startup
